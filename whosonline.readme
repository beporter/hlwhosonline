DESCRIPTION
-----------
This script package is designed to allow the display of players currently 
connected to a Half-Life server on a webpage. There are basically three parts
to the script. The first is a CounterStrike class, written by Henrik Schack 
Jensen <henrik@schack.dk>, that gathers and stores information from a 
Half-Life server. The second half is an .inc file that provides functions that
can be used to output data in a web page. The third part is an .html and a .php
file that together form the front end of the package. More on that under the
section called INSTALLING.

REQUIRES
--------
 + A Half-Life server's IP address and port number
 + Access to a web server with PHP 4+
 + The ability to follow some instructions
 + A bit of common sense

INSTALLING
----------
1) If you're reading this, you've already decompressed the script package.

2) Create a non web-accessable directory. Start by putting all of the files in 
   this package in this directory.

3) Now you have a choice: 
   
   A) If you would like to use this script as a standalone page on your site, 
      move whosonline.php and whosonline.html to a web-accessable directory and
      rename whosonline.html to whatever you want to call the page, plus the 
      ".php" file extension. Link other pages to this file, NOT the original
      whosonline.php.
      
   B) To use this script inside a pre-existing web page (such as the homepage
      for your web site), open up whosonline.html and take a look at it. At the
      very least you need to take from this file the "require_once()" and the 
      <table>. Using whosonline.html as a reference, edit the web page you want 
      to add the script to. After you're done, move whosonline.php to a web 
      accessable directory (preferably the same as the page you added the Who's 
      Online table to). Make sure the page uses the file extension .php or the 
      PHP parser will not run through this file when a user requests it.
      
   For both of these methods, be sure to set correct permissions for any files 
   you add to a web directory.
   
4) Now you must make sure each file knows where it's other files are. Start
   with the web page you link other pages to (either the renamed whosonline.html
   file -or- the web page you added the output table to). Make sure this file 
   points to whosonline.php. If they are in the same directory, "whosonline.php"
   is sufficient. Otherwise, use the absolute filesystem path to the file.
   whosonline.php declares the other files used, so edit it to point to them,
   again using absolute paths.
   
5) Now configure whosonline.php with the rest of the settings required for your
   server. Further isntructions on this are in whosonline.php itself. 
   
6) That's it. Now open the web page and make sure things are coming out right.
   If they aren't, read this file again. Then check to make sure your file
   locations are correct. If that's still not it, panic for a while and give
   up. No, actually, you can email Brian at <beporter@users.sourceforge.net>.
